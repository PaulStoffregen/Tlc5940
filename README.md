Fork of https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Tlc5940 with ESP32 support

Tested on ESP32, but should work on ESP32-S2, S3, etc. with no or minimal mods
Requires the following board support package in Arduino IDE (Tools -> Board -> Boards Managerâ€¦): esp32 by Espressif Systems

DOT Correction can be set for each channel individually.
Animation doesn't work as PROGMEM snippets for ESP32 were not finished.

# Tlc5940 Library

16 channel PWM LED driver based on the Texas Instruments TLC5940 chip.

The TLC5940 chip SCK pin is sensitive to signal overshoot.  When used with
Teensy 4.0 or other high speed hardware, especially if using long wires, you
may need to add a resistor inline with the SCLK signal.
